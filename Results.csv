$NIO is the Chinese winner!
True competitors are the German ones!",XPEV,XPeng Inc.,0,0

$NIO: -8%
$LI: -12.9%
$XPEV: -19%
Look beyond just absolute numbers.
Good job all three (no position in LI or XPEV), NIO my favorite by miles. Why?
1- Li is technically a 1 model hybrid.
2- XPEV sells way less SUVs than NIO at a much lower price.",XPEV,XPeng Inc.,0,0
